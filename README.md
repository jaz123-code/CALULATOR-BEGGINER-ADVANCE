## üìñ Project Overview and Goals

The **Calculator Project** is a comprehensive educational tool designed to demonstrate Python programming concepts through two distinct calculator implementations. This project serves multiple learning objectives:

### üéØ Primary Goals
- **Educational Focus**: Provide clear, well-documented examples for Python learners at different skill levels
- **Progressive Learning**: Start with simple CLI concepts and advance to complex GUI programming
- **Best Practices**: Demonstrate proper code organization, testing, documentation, and version control
- **Real-World Applications**: Show how to build practical tools with Python's standard library

### üåü Key Learning Outcomes
- Command-line interface development
- GUI programming with Tkinter
- File I/O operations and data persistence
- Error handling and input validation
- Code organization and modular design
- Testing and documentation practices

## ‚ö° Quick Start (TL;DR)

**Get up and running in 30 seconds:**

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calculator-project.git
cd calculator-project
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run CLI version
python beginner-cli/calculator_beginner.py

# Run GUI version
python advanced-gui/calculator_advanced.py
```

**That's it!** No complex setup, no external databases, just pure Python.

## üöÄ Usage

### CLI Calculator Usage

**Interactive Menu Mode:**
```bash
# Direct execution
python beginner-cli/calculator_beginner.py

# As a module
python -m beginner_cli.calculator_beginner
```

**Sample CLI Session:**
```
Welcome to the calculator with history feature!
1. CALCULATE  2. SHOW HISTORY  3. CLEAR HISTORY  4. EXIT
Enter your choice: 1
Enter the equation to calculate: 15 * 8 + 12
Result: 132
Result saved to history

1. CALCULATE  2. SHOW HISTORY  3. CLEAR HISTORY  4. EXIT
Enter your choice: 2
15 * 8 + 12 = 132
```

**Programmatic Usage:**
```python
from beginner_cli.calculator_beginner import calculate, show_history

# Direct calculation
result = calculate("25 + 17")
print(f"Result: {result}")

# Show calculation history
show_history()
```

### GUI Calculator Usage

**Launch GUI Application:**
```bash
# Direct execution
python advanced-gui/calculator_advanced.py

# As a module
python -m advanced_gui.calculator_advanced
```

**Programmatic Integration:**
```python
from advanced_gui.calculator_advanced import CalculatorGUI
import tkinter as tk

# Embed in larger application
root = tk.Tk()
calc_frame = tk.Frame(root)
calc = CalculatorGUI(master=calc_frame)
calc_frame.pack()
root.mainloop()
```

**Keyboard Shortcuts (GUI):**
- `Enter` / `Return`: Evaluate expression
- `Escape`: Clear current input
- `Backspace`: Delete last character
- `Numbers` and `Operators`: Direct input

### Advanced Usage Examples

**Batch Processing:**
```python
# Process multiple calculations
expressions = ["10 + 5", "20 * 3", "100 / 4"]
for expr in expressions:
    result = safe_eval(expr)
    print(f"{expr} = {result}")
```

**History Export:**
```python
# Export calculation history to CSV
import csv
from advanced_gui.calculator_advanced import read_history

history = read_history()
with open('calculations.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['Expression', 'Result'])
    for line in history:
        if ' = ' in line:
            expr, result = line.split(' = ', 1)
            writer.writerow([expr, result])
```
